# grade-average

Using c++, I use this to test my knowledge of all the programming concepts I learned.
This program is meant to calculate the average grade from an array, which has a maximum constraint of 25 numbers.
It loops through the array and displays the numeric and letter grade.
I used Visual Studio Enterprise 2015 to complete this program.
